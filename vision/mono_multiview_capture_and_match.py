"""Two-frame monocular baseline test for the 이동 구간 (movement zone) 방향 B.

Captures frame A, moves the drone forward a fixed step, captures frame B,
then runs ORB detection + BFMatcher + RANSAC (Fundamental matrix) to check
whether the matches are clean enough to build Essential-matrix pose recovery
and triangulation on top of (steps 5-8 of the mono-multiview plan).

TEMPORARY validation script, not the production node — see fly_to_marker_and_capture.py
for the pattern this will move to once matching is proven reliable: a persistent
ROS2 node subscribing to the camera continuously, like aruco_pnp_node.py, rather
than a one-shot script. BASELINE_NORTH is hardcoded for now; production will read
the real frame-to-frame displacement from PX4 vehicle_local_position for scale
correction (step 7) instead.
